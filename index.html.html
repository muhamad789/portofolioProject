        <h3>Barbarian</h3>
        <p>Barbarian King is a melee Hero, attacking at close range using his sword. You could say a giant version of the Barbarians. Having a high HP, Barbarian King is capable of being a tanker and the damage he produces is quite high, though not as high as other heroes<p>

        <p>"This colossal threat absorbs massive amounts of damage and slays anything in its path. He guards his territory fiercely while defending, and can unleash a devastating rage on offense once his Iron Fist ability"</p>
        <p>the king of the Barbarians is the first Hero to be unlocked at Town Hall level 7. He is a bigger, stronger, more aggressive, more impressive, and more powerful Barbarian</p>
        <p>The Barbarian King will defend the village whenever his health does not recover from the previous attack. The Barbarian King only defended his territory around his platform and would retreat if provoked too far. If a village is attacked while its health is restored, its altar will be empty. If he locks up an army, he will follow that troop until he dies or the troop is killed. Once troops are killed, and he is outside his patrol zone, he will return to patrolling around his altar, even if the altar is destroyed. You don't need to knock out the Barbarian King (or any Hero other than the Grand Warden ) to get three stars in the base.</p></div>
